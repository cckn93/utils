    "## **1. Portfolio Returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Financial Markets, you were introduced to asset and portfolio returns. In Financial Data, we will explore both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional datasets. Therefore, matrix representations in linear algebra will be the main gateway for dealing with this subject. This makes sense because a portfolio consists of $n$ assets with returns $r_{i}, i \\in \\{1,n\\}$ that can be arranged in a matrix $r$ where each column is represented by an asset. In this context, $r_{i}$ are vectors, and **in the absence of perfect multicollinearity**, it is true that $\\text{dim}(\\text{span}(r_{i})) = n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that the portfolio returns are:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{p} = \\sum_{1}^{n} w_{i} \\cdot r_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "* $r_{p}$: portfolio returns\n",
    "* $r_{i}$: asset $i$ returns\n",
    "* $w_{i}$: the weight of asset $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "We should have an additional constraint in mind:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{1}^{n} w_{i} = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and for the purposes of this lesson, we will also assume that shorting is not allowed:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{i} > 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the return of the portfolio $r_{p}$ is a linear combination of the returns of each asset. By construction, we have that $r_{p} \\in \\text{span}(r_{i})$ for every combination of the weights. That means that the assets that an investor chooses are the basis (in a Linear Algebra context) of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now write the portfolio returns in the format we will be using for the rest of the lesson and make the notation clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{p} = \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{r} = \\begin{bmatrix} r_1 & r_2 & \\dots & r_n \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ , } \\mathbf{w} = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ w_n \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and each $r_{i}$ is a vector that represents the returns of each asset across time $t$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{i} = \\begin{bmatrix} r^i_{t_{1}} \\\\ r^i_{t_{2}} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ r^i_{t_{m}} \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $1$ as the sum of all weights has an intuitive explanation: we construct the portfolio by using a percentage of each asset (the weights) until we use the entire amount ($1$ means $100\\%$). What does it mean if we break that constraint?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your favorite finance textbook and online resources in researching the constraint $\\sum_{1}^{n} w_{i} = 1$. What would it mean for a portfolio if $\\sum_{1}^{n} w_{i} = 2$ ? Answer the same question but now for $\\sum_{1}^{n} w_{i} = 0$. Initiate a discussion in the forum explaining your understanding.\n",

    "## **2 Types of Returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we have essentially presented a way to calculate portfolio daily percent returns. But these returns are not the only ones used in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Percentage Returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentage returns, also known as simple returns or arithmetic returns, are commonly used in practice:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{t} = \\frac{p_{t} - p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $p_{t}$ is the price of an asset at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest bonus of using these returns is that the interpretation is intuitive: they directly represent the percentage change in value. A drawback is that they are not additive across time for one asset even though, for the exact same reason they are commonly used with portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implications of nonadditivity are simple to show: imagine that you have an asset of price $A$. The first month, the price appreciates by $20\\%$, but at the end of the second month, the price falls by $18\\%$. If the returns were additive, one could just add them $20\\% - 18\\% = 2\\%$ and argue that the total return for the 2 months is $2\\%$. But as we will see in a future section, that is not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the simple returns are not symmetrical. There is no boundary to the upside, yet it is bounded on the downside. Intuitively, the returns of a share cannot be less than $-100\\%$ since the price would become negative. On the upside though, the returns can go really high especially when dealing with large horizons. Another way to showcase this is with the following observation: the price of an asset in three consecutive months is 100 -> 120 -> 100. At the end of the second month, the returns are $20\\%$, but at the end of the third month, they are $-16.6\\%$. If the simple returns were symmetrical, then it would require the same absolute number of returns for going from 100 to 120 and then back to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a custom function in Python that given a price array (for example `asset_prices['MSFT']`), will return the array of the arithmetic returns. You are not allowed to use any existing Python functions. Cross-check the results with the ones produced by using the `pct_change` pandas function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Logarithmic Returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "The log returns, also known as continuously compounded returns, make use of the natural logarithm in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{t_\\text{log}} = ln \\left ( \\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}} \\right )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the percent returns, the log returns are additive for one asset over time:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{(t_{i}-t_{j})_{\\text{log}}} = \\sum_{t = i}^{t = j} r_{t_\\text{log}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "they are also assumed (not always correctly) to be normally distributed, which is an important assumption for many econometric and stochastic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additivity is responsible for the name \"continuously compounded returns\" since now you can just calculate the total returns over large horizons simply by adding the intra-period log returns. This creates a problem though: if we have the individual logarithmic returns of several assets, does it make sense to use them in order to calculate the returns of the portfolio? If adding log returns is a compounding process, are you allowed to add log returns of different assets?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the above questions is **no** and one needs to take extra care in order to use the correct type of return for each use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the log returns are symmetrical. Mathematically, we can see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "log \\left ( \\frac{p_{t}}{p_{t-1}} \\right ) = - log \\left ( \\frac{p_{t-1}}{p_{t}} \\right )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the numbers of the above example, we can see that the log returns from 100 to 120 are equal (but negative sign) with the log returns of 120 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a custom function in Python that, given a price array (for example `asset_prices['MSFT']`), will return the array of the logarithmic returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have illustrated above, we can only distinguish between the two kinds of returns in terms of use cases. But now we need to be a bit more specific as to when and how. In order to do so, we need to do one observation:"

    "When analyzing investment returns, it's essential to choose the ppropriate mean based on the context. The arithmetic mean is **the correct measure for calculating expected returns in statistical models and portfolio optimization**. It represents the average return per period without considering the compounding effect. This is crucial when forecasting future returns, calculating expected portfolio returns, and performing risk assessments, as it aligns with the linear properties required in these calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the geometric mean accurately reflects the average compounded growth rate over multiple periods. It accounts for the effects of compounding and is suitable for evaluating the historical performance of an investment over time. However, the geometric mean should not be used in place of the arithmetic mean when performing statistical analyses or modeling expected returns, as it does not provide an unbiased estimate of future performance.\n",

    "Let's read the above illustration, which admittedly is one of the most important in portfolio management.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to observe the shape of the frontier: the curve-like line that spans the left and upper part of the scatter plot represents all possible optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk (or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return). This curve is called the **efficient frontier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if we were to draw vertical lines on this graph, each line would intersect the frontier at a point representing the portfolio with the highest return for that specific level of risk. At the same time, there are plenty of weights that expose the portfolio to the same level of risk but for less return. That should bring our attention to the fact that even though the weights are subjective, if the portfolio that an investor chose does not lie in the efficient frontier, then the investor can do better in terms of returns by following the vertical line upwards until reaching the efficient frontier. In short, for any given level of risk (variance), there is an optimal portfolio composition that maximizes returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same as above is true if we were to draw horizontal lines. In this case, we can claim that for any given level of returns, we can minimize risk by following the horizontal line to the left up until it crosses the efficient frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move up and to the right along the frontier, we see higher potential returns but also higher risk. This illustrates the fundamental principle that to achieve higher returns, one generally must accept higher risk. The concave shape of the frontier illustrates the benefits of diversification. Portfolios on the frontier are typically well diversified, offering better risk-return profiles than individual assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 11:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your own portfolio, one to your liking: choose one or more equities, ETFs, bonds, and crypto. Try to include assets that are not that correlated with the rest of the portfolio (if this is possible) and also include some very high-volatility assets (large marketcap altcoins or newly issued ones). Use the code provided above in order to construct the efficient frontier. Paste the graph in the forums along with a **small** paragraph that lists the assets chosen.\n",

    "**Exercise 12 (Optional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first paragraph of this notebook, we mentioned that given $n$ vectors $r_{i}$, in the absence of multicollinearity, it is true that $\\text{dim}(\\text{span}(r_{i})) = n$. Otherwise, the dimension of the $\\text{span}$ will be lower than $n$. This is a known result from linear algebra. Use your favorite linear algebra textbook in order to remember what multicollinearity is and then argue why an investor would keep an asset in their portfolio when that asset could be written as a perfect linear combination of the rest of the portfolio assets. Should the investor just omit such an asset? What is its contribution to lowering portfolio variance or increasing returns? Does it give flexibility in portfolio management?\n",

    "**Exercise 13:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this lesson, students were introduced to the correct usage of the arithmetic and geometric mean. In Section *2.4 Annualizing Returns*, we explained how to annualize the percent and log returns if the compounding effect was needed. Still, when constructing the efficient frontier, we did this: `expected_returns = r.mean() * 252`. Why? In your answer, consider the context of portfolio optimization and whether we are focusing on modeling expected returns for statistical purposes or calculating the actual historical growth of an investment due to compounding. Discuss the implications of using the arithmetic mean in this context."

    "## **8. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we learned that logarithmic returns are additive and useful for longer-term analysis, while percentage returns are more intuitive for short-term performance evaluation. We also discovered how to annualize returns, allowing for fair comparisons between investments with different time horizons.\n",
    "The lesson emphasized the importance of understanding portfolio variance and its components. We saw how individual asset variances, weights, and correlations all play crucial roles in determining overall portfolio risk. The efficient frontier concept illustrated the trade-off between risk and return, highlighting the benefits of diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through practical examples and exercises using Python, we've gained hands-on experience in calculating and interpreting these metrics. This knowledge forms a crucial foundation for more advanced topics in portfolio management and financial analysis."
